This project is a study of creating a donut shape using Three.js, a JavaScript 3D library. The 3D donut model was created using Blender and can be found in the model folder as donut.blend. The demo includes interactive controls using Dat.gui, a lightweight controller library for Three.js, allowing the user to adjust the velocity, light and position of the donut.
